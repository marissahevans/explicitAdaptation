%This file is the main control script for the experiment. For each session
%edit the necessary information in the Participant Info section then run

%This s  cript calls several functions, namely:
%screenVisuals.m - sets up colors and screens
%startExp.m - st  arts psychToolbox
%controlExpSigmaP.m -session 1 control expe riment (+practice trials)
%pracTrialSeq.m - practice trial s  for main experiment
